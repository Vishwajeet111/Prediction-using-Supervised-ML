# Prediction-using-Supervised-ML
In this project, we have been a dataset containing marks scored by the students and number of hours they have spend for studying.The task given to us is to build a ML model
that can predict the marks that can be scored based on the number of hours spend.
The ML model is build with the help of linear regression algorithm.
